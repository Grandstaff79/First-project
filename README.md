Print "Hello World"
I am somewhat new to programming. I am currently attending Purdue Global University and have about 2 years left to get my Bachelor's Degree in Programming and Software Development. With me still being new to the programming world, I would like to get some help from some veteran programmers on where I need to start and how to get a work station set up properly so I can get better at programming. I plan to start out using either Visual Studio Code or Eclipse or HTML and JAVASCRIPT. I could use all the help to get started in the right direction on getting a simple app started and finished throughout the entire process. My ultimate goal is to eventually get a decent paying job doing what I would think to be an interesting and creative job. 
Thanks in advance
